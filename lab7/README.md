## Problem Statement:

1. Write a server (TCP) Program that opens a listening socket and waits to serve theclient. It also has a module of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.\\
2. Write a client (TCP) Program that connects with the server program knowing theIP address and port number.
3. Get the input adjacency matrix of topology, source and destination node from theconsole on the client and send it to the server. Server will return the shortest pathand its cost from source to destination. The client will display the shortest pathand its cost on its own console.

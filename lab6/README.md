## Problem Statement:

1. Write a server (TCP) Program that opens a listening socket and waits to serve theclient. It also consists of 3 modules for three topology creations (Tree, Ring, Star)\\
2. Write a client (TCP) Program that connects with the server program knowing theIP address and port number.\\
3. Get the input topology, and a number of nodes from the console on the clientand send it to the server, server constructs the topology on request and sends the adjacency list and degree of the node to the client. The client will display the adjacency list and degree of the node on its own console.
